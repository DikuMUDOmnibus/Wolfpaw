**************************************************************************

------------Background Info------------
Hello there, if you are reading this, I'll truely be amazed seeing as I
usually don't read ReadMe files either. Anyway I made this cause I got
sick of deleting all the log files on the SMAUG MUD I help run.  This
script works rather well, however it still has some bugs.  Some of you who
know a lot about shell scripts will probably see some of what I did and
ask "what the hell was he thinking?!?".  Well I do a lot of things in a
round-a-bout way, so if you know how to make it more efficient, just drop
me a line please, and I'll include you in the credits. 


------------About the Script------------
Exactly what does Clean do? Well thats easy.. what it does is when run it
lists all of your log files, and omits to most recent(one the MUD is
currently writing to if it's up).  Then it puts all but the most recent
log file into a file, compresses that file, names it today's date, and
moves it to a Backlog directory. Also, the data.cln file is basically the
clean script, I did it that way so I could give clean an argument and have
it do stuff(This is one of those things I did in a round-a-bout way as
mentioned above). But please keep clean with data.cln. Also this script is
absulutey free! And if you know any other SMAUG MUDs, give them this
script freely.  I say only SMAUG 'cause I have yet to try it on any other.


------------Installation Notes------------
Only one thing to remember while installing, just put clean and data.cln
in the log directory and thats it.


------------Final Note------------
Again, if you have any ideas how to improve clean, please email them to
me, also if you have any further questions, also email me. My address is
