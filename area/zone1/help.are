-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Associated help files: authorize
 
Authorize <player> name -- This is the command used to allow a player to
  continue in the Spectral Gate pre-auth area, but will make them choose
  a new name prior to entering the Academy.  Use this command if the name
  is questionable, modern, or rude.  If the name is acceptible, but in all
  caps, accept the name, but send them a tell requesting they not use all
  caps for their name in the future.
 
Authorize <player> yes -- This is used to accept a players name.  Once this
  command is used, the player requires no further Immortal commands to enter
  the Realms.
 
Authorize <player> no -- This command is exclusively used to deny players
  with extremely rude or profane names and banned sites.  Use this command
  sparingly.
 
Levels 51-54 have primary responsibility for character authorization.  All
Immortals should periodically type 'authorize' to assure their are not any
players waiting for authorization.  The new system allows the Immortals a
bit of time to decide if an name is appropriate before accepting or denying
it.  If you are in doubts to a names acceptibilty, but it is not profane or
extremely modern, you should probably accept it.

51 521~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
521 has been a long standing clan in this realm. There are a few things
that one must abide by in order to become an active member of 521. First:
There are a few things that this club stands for 1. Loyalty - if you
decide to leave 521 DO NOT ask to come back ever, NO EXCEPTIONS!!
2. Help - although we are a PK clan we are still here not only to help 
eachother as well as the players that are less experienced than us..and
any time that we can we should help both higher and lower players with 
tasks where we feel we can be useful. 3. Respect -  It is expected that 
you respect your fellow members, giving a player a hard time is fine,
just let them you know you are j/k, also the members that have been members
of this clan for a long time will for the most part rank high, they have 
earned the right to be respected by all in 521. On a side note the only
people that we ask you respect outside of 521 are those above 51 and 
ESPECIALLY the IMPLEMENTORS they deserve at least this much. Finally:
have fun, that's what we are all here for. On a side note if you are not
interested in PK but you like what 521 stands for talk to Sentra or the
current leader of 521 and they will TRY to arrange something.. no promises
though.
 
In order to be accepted into this clan you must be voted upon
by all of the current members and the heirarchy, if you are 
accepted you will go to step 2. There will then be a full member
meeting and Sentra, Wayne and Romulus will have to be on to
transfer you there any questions you have or the members have for
you will be answered there. Finally you will have to prove to
us that you are willing to die for this clan to protect it's
members or its integrity we will decide this test as we feel
fit.

.                MOVING THROUGHOUT GAME:
                ---------------------------
The game divided into many rooms which are connected by various
directionals to make up areas.  When you are in a room, you can
find the exits in the room by typing EXITS.  Autoexit is a helpful
command to initiate (type CONFIG +AUTOEXIT), because it will
automatically show you what exits there are in the room.  Be warned
however, you will only see the obvious exits.  You must pay attention
to the room descriptions to see if there might be any doors or hidden
passages in the room. 

Directional commands: (in parentheses you find the shorthand)
NORTH (n)    SOUTH (s)    EAST (e)    WEST (w)     UP (u)     DOWN (d)
NORTHEAST (Ne)  NORTHWEST (Nw)  SOUTHEAST (Se)  SOUTHWEST (Sw)
 
Note:  You will notice that in the prompt <20hp 10bp 20mv>, the 'mv'
       refers to your movement points.  If your movement points were
       to run out, you will be unable to move between rooms due to 
       exhaustion.  If you type SLEEP or REST your movement points will
       slowly be replenished.  You must type STAND or WAKE before 
       walking again.

53 ADVANCEDEXITS~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction,
as well as the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one,
use a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to
refer to it by number:
redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
 
To know what number an exit is, do an "rstat".
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one
of the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It is also usually a good
idea to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
If a player types 'swim' in the room, they will move to room 3001.

0 AUCTION~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: Mon Feb  7 21:43 MST, by: Taizu -=-=-=-=-

~
Syntax: auction 
Syntax:	auction <item name> <starting value>
Syntax:	auction bid <value>
Syntax:	auction stop

The auction command is used for performing auctions.  Simply typing 
auction will display the current item being auctioned, if there is one.  

If nothing is being auctioned, auction <item name> <starting value> will 
begin an auction.  If no starting value is specified, it will start at 0 
gold.

Auction bid <value> will place a bet for the item, and 
auction stop (immortals only) will stop an auction in progress. 

Special thanks to Erwin Andreasen for writing this function.
(Ported here from a publicly available source.)

At the present, if the mud crashes in mid auction, you will lose both 
your bidded money and the item.  This will soon be fixed.
 
You are able to see auction almost from the point of character creation,
however, you cannot USE auction until level THREE or higher.  To remove
the auction channel from your screen, type CHANNEL -AUCTION.
 
&RDO NOT misrepresent something that you are auctioning.  Anyone caught
auctioning a piece of eq that has been renamed to be a more sought after
piece inside a portal where it cannot be identified will be slain.&w

0 'AUGURER'~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
The Augurer is very strong-minded in its nature, both physically and
magically. It is very confident of its actions in combat, and this
confidence shows in its physical appearance.  The Augurer is of a
medium height, with a defined bone structure which shows both
intelligence and assurance.  Its appearance is wizened, but at times
the Augurer may look frail due to exhaustion.  Though it is of a
medium size, its physical strength is not.  The Augurer relies on
both brain and brawn to overcome its challengers.  When it is
confronted, its wisdom decides what course of action it should take,
and wisdom is its prime stat.
 
While in combat, the Augurer is capable of utilizing both spells and
skills to their greatest potential.  However, because of the Augurer's
size, it tires of magic easily.  To overcome this mental exhaustion,
the Augurer is a strong believer in the use of mana for rejuvination
of its magical powers, and uses a lot of it.  In its spare time, the
Augurer enjoys the local lore, both the teaching and learning of it,
as well as musical and theatrical pursuits.  The Augurer is a very
independent person, and spends much of its spare time in meditation,
reflecting upon the days activities.

ok, this is just the guidelines i used myself when i started to
re-edit mahntor eq, so its not _the_ cps, just a general guideline to follow.
 
clubs and maces should be cleric...
eq should have a MAX of 2 layers
daggers, mages and thieves
weapons should just have a nice avdam and damroll/hitroll
items restricted to ONE affect, ie, sanc, iceshield, fireshield, etc
wearable stuff to be group based, ie, warrior/kinju/paladin/blademaster have
access to same eq, unless RP says that the class gets that type of eq,
an example is platemail for paladins (someome told me that)
an absoloute max of 300hp/mana etc (thats for quads)
dual eq shouldnt have too much hp bonus's, concentrate on wis/int/etc
 
i think that covers what i had in mind, feel free to make any suggestions,
cos like i said, these arent the rules, its what i am gonna follow myself

51 BUILDING~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
.
As a builder here you have complete control over your area as long as you
stick to a few simple guidlines.
 
1) No outrageous equipment or mobs.
   Keep your area fair and fun for the players. No one like aggressive 55th 
   level mobs running amock. Same goes with equipment, make sure that the
   power of an item matches the the area it is in and the mobs it is carried
   by.
 
2) No Towns!
   
   There are enough Midgaards and Thaloses already, a few shops are ok but 
   please stay away from towns.
 
3) Use creativity!
   This is probably the most important rule. Players don't want to explore an
   area you made by bastardizing a couple of your favorite areas. We need 
   new and interesting areas to make this mud stand out from the rest.
 
4) Don't get too pissed off if your area isn't installed.
   It's up to the Head Creator, Kommite members and Implementors wether or
   not your area is installed in the mud so please don't be sore if your area
   is made part of the mud, just start a new one and make it better than the 
   last.

0 CAST~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

1 CHANNELS~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Syntax: channels
Syntax: channels +<channel|all>
Syntax: channels -<channel|all>
 
With no options, CHANNELS show you your current channels.  With a plus
or minus sign and an option, CHANNELS turns that channel on or off.  With
all as the option, CHANNELS will turn on/off all normal channels
 
The first channels you will have available as a new player are SAY, TELL,
and NEWBIE.  To use say, the person you want to talk to must be in the same
room, just type SAY <message>.  To use tell, the target person may be
anywhere, just type TELL <name or 0.name> [message].

Newbiechat is seen and used by only level 1 characters and the Immortals

51 CHANSET~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Syntax:  chanset <player>             - see a players current IMC flags
         chanset <player> +<channel>  - set 'allow' flag on a player
         chanset <player> -<channel>  - set 'deny' flag on a player
         chanset <player> =<channel>  - reset allow/deny flags on a player

This command allows you to view or change a players IMC channel priviliges.
In all cases <channel> can be the name of an IMC channel (rchat, rcode, etc)
or 'rtell' or 'rbeep'.

Setting the allow flag for a channel allows that player to see and use that
channel, regardless of their level. This can be used, for example, to give
mortals with coding experience access to rcode.

Setting the deny flag for a channel prevents that player from using or
seeing that channel, even if their level normally allows them to. This can be
used as a penalty for players who abuse the IMC channels or rtell/rbeep.

Resetting the allow/deny flags simply clears them, using only the player's
level to determing whether they can use the channel.

1 CLANRULES~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Ok we (the administration) are tired of people breaking rules
so we have decided to spell them out in the most straightforward
way....
 
1 - Do not give clan items to anyone outside the clan or donate them
  -- This is pretty serious and it will most likely result in being
  -- dismembered from the clan and being outcast (unable to join a clan)
  -- so don't do it
2 - If you teleport into another clan's hall LEAVE
  -- The temptation to take things or interfere with that clan is
  -- too high.. anyone caught in a clan hall other then there own
  -- will first simply be transfered back to mithras or their own
  -- hall.. if it persists however, count on a dismember or losing
  -- that spell
 
NOTE - Other rules are common sense.. if you don't know, ask
       These rules may be amended at any time depending on the imm's
       current mental state :P
 
Guess what folks the 521 stuff belongs to clan Knight so unless
you're in that clan you MAY NOT have 521 eq this means in plain english
ANYTHING FOUND, BOUGHT, LOOTED, or otherwise gotten from the 521
pyramid is ILLEGAL except to people in clan Knight
 
AMENDMENT TO RULE 1 -
   Anyone caught with items beloging to a clan other then there own
   May be LEGALLY pkilled outside the arena by members of that clan
   The killer must tell an immortal first though or face a killer flag

1 COMBAT~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
You may choose a fight by finding a mob, and using LOOK, CONSIDER, and
IDENTIFY to gauge the difficulty of the opponent.  You can LOOK <mob>
to get a look at its equipment and description, this will often help
indictate how hard a fight might be.  You can CONSIDER <mob> for a one
on one comparison of the mobs hitpoints and level to your own.  You may
also CAST IDENTIFY <mob> to get more detailed information about the mob.
 
You may start a fight by using KILL, MURDER, or many spells and skills
available to players.  The easiest way to start a fight is to KILL <mob>.
Currently, you may also MURDER <mob>, but this causes the mob to yell out.
 
You may find yourself in trouble during a fight, and wish to leave, this
can be done by using FLEE or RECALL.  You can flee a fight by typing FLEE.
You may recall from a fight with the spell 'word of recall' or by reciting
a recall scroll.  You may also set it up to flee automatically once you go
below a certain number of hitpoints by using WIMPY.  To use your wimpy, type
WIMPY or WIMPY <number of hitpoints>.  Leaving a fight with wimpy, flee, and
recall WILL cost you a loss of experience, with recall causing the greatest
loss.

~

1 'COMMON SENSE'~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
.
These are some general guide lines that should be followed at all times.
 
        * NO Swearing at Immortals
        * If an immortal speaks LISTEN! cause in case ya didn't know they 
          weren't picked at random out of a hat and have earned the right to
          be where they are.
        * MANNERS go a long way in getting whatever it is that you might want.
          Just in case ya hadn't figured it out yet, the immortals aren't
          paid to be here, they CHOOSE to be here and make AOTA a better
          place for the people to come here.
        * If ya expect the immortals to be at your beck and call go find a
          mud where they will be!  (may i suggest some of the pay-per-plays)
        * Be nice to other players as well.  Constantly begging for eq just
          angers everyone, and it is quite likely to get pkilled or worse
          if you persist on doing it.
        * Greywolf has more than enough on his plate and has much better things
          to do then look after little stuff, try asking an imm first (they
          can usually direct you to the appropriate person, if they can't
          help you themselves).
        * As a general rule if you get silenced, helled, banished, slayed or
          destroyed, you more than likely deserved it.  If you feel it was
          EXTREMELY unjust, take it up with that immortal.  (USE MANNERS and
          TACT, btw whining will probably get you even harsher punishment.)
          Also, use mud mail, creation of other character, or using other
          existing multi's will probably get them the same punishment or a
          site ban imposed.
 
Now, I know you are all thinking "I know all of this" .. in that case good
keep following it... and if any of this is new, well maybe it will stop you
from being on the bad side of the immortals who make this place better and
run alot smoother.

GET ALL <container> allows you to take everything from a container at once.

-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Creation Point System (CPS) - This system was created to prevent putting +100
hp/mana/move, +30 hit/damroll on level mobs with only 300 HP.  This is also
to standardize the eq a little bit and make for a more diverse sets and stats
of eq in the game!  --AOTA Hyperions
Each piece of eq that you make will be given a certain number of points that
that it is allowed and each affect, charbit, etc that you add to it will cost
a certain number of points.  This system basically uses the mob level (amoung
other things) to determine how powerful the eq can be, but you can also add
negative affects to increase something else.
*-*Section I - This section shows you how to determine how CP's you get from
a mob. The following is the creation points per stat:
LEVEL
-65 is the max level
HITPOINTS
-this works with HITPLUS only - mobs should be set like with HITPLUS 
ARMOR CLASS
-minus numbers only
MOB AFFECTS
-infravision, detect_invis, etc 
MISC.
-number of attacks, sanctuary, aggressive
*-*Section II - This section lays out how much cpt's it costs to give certain
bonuses to eq.  Damage for weapons isn't listed, but it should be resonable
(no insane average dam!) and will be reviewed by imms.
ARMOR CLASS
-up to 90pts
HIT/MANA/MOVE
-up to 100 points
STATS (STR/INT/WIS/CON/etc)
-up to 8
DAM/HITROLL
-up to 20
***NOTE***
A mob w/ a piece of eq that has +5 hit/dam or higher, must have a minimum
damage rate of 25d25+25.  A mob w/ a piece of eq that has +10 hit/dam or
higher, must have a minimum damage rate of 50d50+250.  A mob w/ a piece
of eq that has +15 hit/dam or higher, must have a minimum damage rate of
75d75+500.
*-*Section III - This section lays out how many cpt's it will cost for affects
WEARSPELLS/AFFECTS:
 
-Invis,Fly,Sneak,Hide,True Sight,Sanctuary,Infravision,Eldritch Sphere
Dragonscale,Dragonskin
(Other spells and such will be added as needed, so don't think you can slip
a few by!  NOTE:  only two WEARSPELLS per piece ALLOWED!  Only ONE affect per
piece as well!!!)
*-*Section IV - Miscellaneous notes regarding the system
1. Negatives:  if you give eq a negative affect you can use that as a bonus,
~

51 CPS2~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
affect. For anti-good/evil/neutral, you receive 15 cpt's each.  For each
anti-<class> you receive 5 cpt's.  Only THREE anti-<class> ALLOWED!!!
2. Multiple pieces of eq on mobs:  Each piece of eq you add can only have
half the points of the preceding piece of eq.  For example, a mob that gave
you 300 pts, the first piece can have 300, the second 150, third 75 and so on.
3. As of now only use the wearspells/affects lised above.  More will be added
later. Ok, I think that's everything.  If you have any questions at all about
how this works, or any suggestions on how to make it better, feel free to any
of the Hyperions know or mudmail Wyverns or Disaster.

1 CR 'CORPSE RETRIEVAL'~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
.
So you died did you?  Well your corpse is where you left it and I'd suggest 
going after it!  But if you are unable to do so you may ask an immortal to 
do it for you, providing certain things have been met already:

1.  You have tried and failed to get on your own
2.  You and others have tried and failed to recover your corpse

And last, the immortal will, depending on if he/she believes you deserve
one, grant you a CR.  But, with all immortal assistance comes a price.  It
will cost you 5 of your best pieces of eq!  THAT'S 5 EQ PIECES, YOUR
BEST ONES.

This is a privilege, not a right, and the immort can at any time can
refuse a CR - do not keep bugging/begging for one or you will face other
consequences.

There are NO CR's for DT's!  You hit a DT, all eq is gone for good!  There are
NO CR's for mobs that SAC corpses, it's like a DT - same rule applies!!!

hp/mana/move, +30 hit/damroll on level mobs with only 300 HP.  This is also
to standardize the eq a little bit and make for a more diverse sets and stats
of eq in the game!  --AOTA Hyperions
 
Each piece of eq that you make will be given a certain number of points that
that it is allowed and each affect, charbit, etc that you add to it will cost
a certain number of points.  This system basically uses the mob level (amoung
other things) to determine how powerful the eq can be, but you can also add
negative affects to increase something else.
 
**Section I - This section shows you how to determine how CP's you get from
a mob.  If you mob is Level 50 with 30,00 HP, -100 AC, w/ SANC, DETECT_INVIS
and it's AGGRO, you would receive 290 CP's.  100 for the level, 100 for the
HP, 10 for the AC, 10 for DETECT_INVIS, 40 for SANC and 30 for being AGGRO.
So you could make a ring that has +10 hit/dam, +200 mana, and 30 AC.  The
following is the creation points per stat:
 
+2 creation points per level - up to level 50 only, 65 is the max
   Ex:  Level 50 mob = +100 pts
+1 creation point per 300 HP - this works with HITPLUS only - mobs should be
set like with HITPLUS - Ex:  "1d1+30000" would = +100 pts
+10 creation points per 100 AC ("-" number sonly)
   Ex:  -400 AC = 40 pts
+10 creation points for infravision/detect_invis/etc - You can only receive
a max of 10 pts tho - Ex:  infravision/detect_invis/detect_magic = +10 pts
+2 creation points per "number of attack" the mob has
   Ex:  20 attacks = +40 pts
+40 creation points for SANC
+30 creation points for AGGRO
 
**Section II - This section lays out how much cpt's it costs to give certain
bonuses to eq.  Damage for weapons isn't listed, but it should be resonable
(no insane average dam!) and will be reviewed by imms.
 
Armor Class
1 creation pt per AC to 30 = 30 pts
2 creation pts per AC to 60 = 90 pts
 
Hit/Mana/Move Points
2 creation pts per 5 hp up to 100 = 40 pts
4 creation pts per 5 hp up to 200 = 100 pts
 
Stats (STR/INT/WIS/CON/etc)
5 creation pts per stat to 2 = 10 pts
10 creation pts per stat to 5 = 40 pts
20 creation pts per stat to 8 = 100 pts
~

51 CREATIONPOINTS2~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Dam/Hitroll
2 creation pts per dam to 5 = 10 pts
10 creation pts per dam to 10 = 60 pts
15 creation pts per dam to 15 = 135 pts
20 creation pts per dam to 20 = 235 pts
***NOTE***
A mob w/ a piece of eq that has +5 hit/dam or higher, must have a minimum
damage rate of 25d25+25.  A mob w/ a piece of eq that has +10 hit/dam or 
higher, must have a minimum damage rate of 50d50+250.  A mob w/ a piece 
of eq that has +15 hit/dam or higher, must have a minimum damage rate of
75d75+500.
 
**Section III - This section lays out how many cpt's it will cost to add
wearspells/affects:
Invis-----------------5
Fly------------------10
Sneak-------------15
Hide----------------15
True Sight--------40
Sanctuary--------40
Infravision--------25
Eldritch Sphere-----25
Dragonscale-----25
Dragonskin-------20
(Other spells and such will be added as needed, so don't think you can slip
a few by!  NOTE:  only two WEARSPELLS per piece ALLOWED!  Only ONE affect per
piece as well!!!)
 
**Section IV - Miscellaneous notes regarding the system
1.  Negatives:  if you give eq a negative affect you can use that as a bonus,
equal to however many points it would have been if it had been a positive
affect.  For anti-good/evil/neutral, you receive 15 cpt's each.  For each
anti-<class> you receive 5 cpt's.  Only THREE anti-<class> ALLOWED!!!
 
2.  Multiple pieces of eq on mobs:  Each piece of eq you add can only have

A "Deadly" character is one who shows up under the Deadly Characters portion
of the Who list (type 'who deadly' to see a list deadly characters online).

Clans are societies composed of a group of players which have joined 
together under a common cause.  If you are a member of a clan you have
the ability to pkill other deadly players outside of your own clan.
Depending on the clan you join, you may be asked  to follow set of
rules dictated by the clan's leaders. 
 
NOTE: Non-deadly and deadly players may join a deadly clan, however when
the character is outcasted it remains deadly.
~

1 DEADLYCLANS~

The role of clans is basically to give a player a group of people
that will help him/her in a time of need.  Clans also have the pk

1 DEATH~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
When you die, you are taken to either of the Main Cities, be it Mithras,
or the CursedLands(ie, your recall point).  If you are lower than level 10,
your corpse will be dropped just west and down from recall, easy to get.
However, if you are older that 10th level, your corpse will be left where
it is.  Unless the creature that killed you is intelligent, if it is the
chances are your corpse will be sacrificed.
 
New feature!
The Gods of AotA have agreed to teach Master Clerics the ability to 
RESSURECT people after they have been slain in combat.  This means that
when you die now, you will have the opportunity to re-gain the stats that
are taken away from you upon death (hp, mana, movement and a level).
No longer do you have the choice to loser either one con point or one level,
the choice is made for you.  Upon a successful ressurection, you automatically
gain them back, minus one strength and one constitution, as well as two
practises.

1 DEXTERITY DEX~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Dexterity (DEX in your 'score') represents your character's agility, and
it affects (among other things):
 
 - the maximum number of items you can carry at once in your inventory;
   with each additional point of dex you can carry additional items.
 
 - each additional point of dexterity also lowers (improves) your natural
   armor class.
 
 - the number of new moves you receive each time you level, as well as the
   number of moves you regenerate at each tick (when resting to refresh or
   regain movement points).
 
 - success chances with bash and stun, and helps determine whether a thief
   will be able to poison a weapon.
 
Dexterity is also very important for quaffing potions in combat.  High dex
will allow you to quaff without dropping many potions during the heat of
battle, while a poor dexterity will cause you to accidentally drop many
of the valuable vials.
 
Dexterity is the prime attribute of thieves and vampires.

~

0 DRUID~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
The druid is a lover and protector of the natural land.  Be it the forests
full of centaurs and deer, the streams full of fish, or the bug-infested
swamps, a druid always strives to protect and preserve nature.  Wielding
mighty spells from the gods themselves, druids strive hard at their work.
 
Strong in wisdom, with a body trained to near perfection by their rugged
lifestyle, a druid has many disciplines upon which to draw.  From powerful
spells of healing which can bring the near dead back to full vigor, to the
ability to mystically create water and food, to the awesome power of nature
which they command in battle via spells able to quake the land and split
the sky, druids demonstrate that mastery of magic is not just a hobby, but
a way of life for them.  Able to face many warriors on almost even footing,
and able to shield themselves nearly as well as some mages, druids are
truly a gifted class.

creatures.  Long-lived and extremely sturdy, they are known equally as well
for their hardiness as for their cantankerous personalities.  Their thick,

race has produced some of the most reknowned fighters.  Dwarves possess the
inherent ability to see in the dark with infravision.
 
Dwarves average from four foot five inches and five feet tall, with dusky
complexions and thick, fur-covered torsos and limbs.  Both men and women

0 ELF ELVES~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Tall, slender creatures with an affinity for the woods and nature, Elves
are distant cousins to the Pixies and share the intelligence and dexterity
of that winged race to a lesser degree.  With a lighter frame than Humans,
what they lack in strength and stamina is made up for with their superior
agility - both in thought and movement.  Elves are capable in all classes,
though they function poorest in the role of pure fighter.  Most Elves will
prefer to stay close to nature, and many become druids.  All Elves have
the inherent ability to detect magic.
 
The average Elf stands taller than most Humans, being well over six feet.
Most have fair skin and long, straight hair, though there are individual
Elves who chose a darker life reflected in their outward appearance.

While in combat, you may notice that your equipment is taking damage.  For
example, you may see "Your lifebane gets damaged."  Each time this happens,
the AC of the item is damaged by one.  If the AC on an item is 5, after it
is damaged more than five times it will be destroyed or scraped.
 
If you wish to preserve the equipment, you must repair it by taking it to
the town blacksmith. (NOTE:  Not all equipment is repairable)  You may also
notice that while fighting a creature which attacks you with acid breath or
another acid attack, your equipment gets "etched and pitted."  When this
occurs the AC on that item is damaged by one permanently.  You cannot
repair the damage done by "pitting and etching."

1 EXCIDIO~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Excidio-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Once, long ago, there was a right and justful king named Arthur. At the
age of 18 he became the ruler of Great Britian. He was the most powerful
and wise ruler of his time.  He had slain dragons, giants, defeated entire
armies and searched for the Holy Grail. Always with him was his sword,
Caldevolc, for as long as he holds it nothing can withstand him.  King
Arthur had a round table, surrounded by the best and bravest knights of 
the realm.  One of these knights was named Tenerin.  Soon after Arthur's
death a new king took over.  He turned out to be even more powerful than
Arthur.  The new kings name was Greywolf.  Too involved in keeping
his realm safe from outside forces, Greywolf assigned Tenerin of the
Round to build a league of the best fighting force possible, to watch
over his kingdom.  And thus Excidio was born.  With Arthur's sword by
his side, Tenerin created this league with one thing in mind, upholding
the law.  Fighting to protect the weak and slay those that oppress the
poor.

52 EXITMAKING~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
For more than one exit in the same direction see ADVANCEDEXITS.

The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.
~

0 EXITS~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

51 EXITTYPES~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
These are the currently valid exit-types:
      0 - Plain exit
      1 - Door exists         (Required to be closed or locked)
      2 - Door is Closed
      4 - Door is Locked
      8 - Door is Secret      (Trying to go that way won't reveal door)
     32 - Door is Pickproof   (Door can't be picked by spell or skill)
     64 - Need to be able to fly to go that way
    128 - Need to be able to climb to go that way
   1024 - Door is Passdoor proof

NOTE: You must ADD the values together to generate an exit-type:
        3 = a closed door
        7 = a closed and locked door
       11 = a closed secret door
       15 = a closed, locked and secret door

-- Use the 'redit exflags' command to change these flags, and to set the
   advanced exit flags, most of which are not shown above.

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Syntax:  level
 
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  Type LEVEL to see
how many experience points you'll need for the next few levels.
 
You gain experience by:
    inflicting damage upon an opponent
    being part of a group that kills an opponent
    succeeding while learning a skill or a spell through real world usage
 
You lose experience by:
    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of some spells (energy drain, etc.)
    dying
 
The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:  how many 
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster;
your alignment versus the monster's alignment and some random variation.
 
Your last 25 kills are recorded.  Each time you kill a creature that has
been one of your last 25 kills you will receive less and less exp for it.
The creature will also learn from its experience with you over time; if
its intelligence is higher than your own it will begin to gain an
advantage over you in combat.

1 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL PORTAL'~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
The Great Wizard Thanatos, after creating his fabled WarMagicks,
found himself snubbed and abused in and about The Realms for his
researches.  Much time would pass before mages and other classes
alike would learn the true power of these spells.
 
In the interim, disguised as an assassin, Thanatos became interested
in a more minor problem: that of carrying off the loot he gained
from all those he slew with Quantum Spike.  Realising that such a
forumla would be easily grasped by his class, he thought to extend
it freely.
 
As a final touch to the spell, he thought he would spite those of
other classes by inbuing into these containers a quality which made
them unobtainable by the other classes.

0 GITH~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
The Gith are a race descended from humans.  Once long ago, they were a
peaceful civilization of humans that were captured by mind flayers and
tormented for centuries.  Eventually, a savior named Gith led them to
freedom, yet their bodies had been flayed by the mental powers of the
illithids.  The Gith found themselves, stronger, quicker, luckier and
smarter than average humans, yet they had lost much of their faith,
wisdom, stamina and charisma.
 
They had yellowed skin and were very long of limb.  Sunken eyes peered
from yellowed sockets, now strangely capable of naturally detecting
invisible things.  The Gith race has split into three distinct groups
recently.  The good, the Githzerai, the selfish neutral, the Pirates
of Gith, and the evil, the Githyanki.

aims to keep the mud varied and interesting.  People who sit there whining for
help, or ask for an IMP in their title, or basically hassle immortals for
prizes when that staff member might be alone, will get nothing and more than
likely lose glory.  (This goes for people asking for an immortal to do a trade
as well, WE will offer when we have the online time to do it, things get hectic
up here, asn any of you budding immortals would know.  Dont ask for a trade.

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY ' TELL~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Syntax: gtell <message>

Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

Here is the following things for editing equipment that i would like
to be considered a maximum .. try to stay at least CLOSE to this.
 
Weapon Damage: (value1 and value2 on weapons) 25D25 max.. thats 2 25's
Armour Class: No Higher then a 75 ac on armor .. and try to keep the added

Hp/mana/move: 300 maximum for QUADS
Damroll and Hitroll: id say max of 25 of each on the hardest to get items
Wearspells: No more then 2 on any item, same with resistancies and immunities e
 
Keeping this in mind .. try to make the eq balance so that all levels have a si
significant differance in eq.. mobs will be next
 
If you would like to participate in this project, balancing the game
and you are a God+, please contact me .. as of right now .. unless
i told you otherwise .. no objects are to be edited except by benny
and kinsman .. as i have discussed it with them.
 
Also .. eq should be class and level restricted, read bennycps for the
class restriction info..and levels should be something you see as fit for an
item of that power range.
 
Thanks,

55 HACK~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Syntax: hack <target>
 
This skill allows you to hack at a target, inflicting damage.
 
~

0 HALF-ELF HALFELF HALFELVES~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
A mixing of Human and Elven blood, these attractive creatures are neither
as intelligent as full-blood Elves (but moreso than Humans), nor as hardy
as full-blood Humans (but moreso than Elves).  They serve best in classes
which require a mix of mental and physical strength without demanding
superiority in either.  Half-elves carry the inherent Elven ability to
see limitedly in the dark with infravision.
 
Though not as tall as a pure-blood elf, a half-elf is a relatively tall
creature ranging from five foot five inches tall to six foot five inches,
with a generally more muscular build than the pure-blooded elf.
 
~

0 HALF-OGRE HALFOGRE~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Half-Ogres are offspring of the successful coupling of the neanderthal-like
Ogre with and Humans.  Standing from six to nine feet in height and packed
with bulging muscles, Half-Ogres possess great physical abilities, enabling
this race to thrive in battle.  Half-ogres tend to be less quick-witted
than humans and, like their pure-blood Ogre relatives, are aggressive in
the extreme, often engaging in battle to establish superiority, leaving the
loser shunned as a weakling incapable of survival.  Because of their human
parentage, Half-Ogres are not as large or powerful as pure-breed Ogres, but
nevertheless boast truly awesome strength.  Half-Ogres possess infravision.
 
The torso and limbs of many Half-Ogre are commonly covered in small, boney
growths.  Most are relatively hairless, with disproportionally long limbs,
giving many an ape-like appearance.  Their weight runs from three hundred
to four hundred pounds.
 
~

0 HALF-ORC HALF-ORCS HALFORC HALFORCS~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
A recent mingling of Orcish and Human blood arising as the darker races
have encroached further upon the remaining settled areas, most members
of this half-blooded race are distinctly more Orcish than Human in both
appearance and behavior.  Large and dull of wit, with short but broad
bodies, their poor mental and physical dexterity is offset by an iron
constitution.  Though some have dabbled in the sorcerous arts due to
their human influence, brute combat is is still the natural call which
stirs in the soul of the Half-Orc.  All Half-Orcs possess infravision.
 
Though not as broad nor powerful as full-blood Orcs, Half-Orcs usually
retain their wider bodies, longer, bowed limbs and heavier musculature.
A ridged brow crowned by bushy eyebrows conceals small, squinting eyes;
below a snout-like noses opens a maw filled with crooked fangs; dark
skin emanating a rancid odor; their presence disgusts civilized races.
Standing from five to seven feet tall and averaging two hundred pounds,
an altogether fearsome race.
 
~

0 HALF-TROLL HALFTROLL~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
An intermingling (carried out in the darker lands of the world) of the
blood of the Troll with that of Humans, the Half-troll is as deadly as
it is hideous.  Though considerably smaller than full-blood Trolls, the
Half-troll often stands well over eight feet in height and carries over
three hundred pounds on its heavily-muscled frame.  Though naturally of
low wisdom, the race was sorcerously imbued with a wicked intelligence
and the ability to see naturally in the darkness.  Half-trolls usually
make poor pure magic users, and suffer from an unusually low dexterity.
Yet their boundless energy and high intellect create one of the most
cunning physical beasts in experienced hands.
 
Owing in part to the black blood which courses through their heavy veins,
the heavily-scaled skin of the Half-troll ranges in color from a charcoal
grey to a deep, blackish green.  Half-trolls revel in the fright of their
appearance, often wearing their hair in battle-braids and emblazoning
themselves with brands and tattoos to accentuate the effect.
 
~

0 HALFLING HALFLINGS~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Short, slender, bull-headed and very mischievous the Halfling has a level
of dexterity which knows no equal, and many enjoy the thrill of stealing
valuables from other people.  Many halflings choose the path of the Thief,
for which their silent footstep and nimble fingers serve them well.  This
dexterity coupled with a surprising fearlessness makes them a ferocious
(though somewhat underpowered) opponent.
 
Halflings have compact bodies and thick, long limbs, and are usually
covered from head to toe in hair of varying thickness and color.
 
~

1 'HAND OF CHAOS'~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Syntax: cast 'hand of chaos' <target>
 
This spell reduces the targets hitroll as well as doing some damage.
~

0 HATCHET~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Hatchet is a Merc Guy.  He founded Merc with Kahn one day in 1992 because one
day, when he complained about muds, the imps said, 'If you have a problem, go 
make your own mud.'  His love is for the mudders, specifically a lady named 
Icaza.

51 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which 
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A 
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will 
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.

Amazingly, Humans have a strange tendency to look different from each the
other; almost none look exactly alike.

1 'ILL FORTUNE'~

Syntax: cast 'ill fortune' <target>
 
This spell causes the target to become very unlucky.
~

50 'IMC CONFIG'~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
The 'imc' command is used to configure your IMC setup:

Syntax:  imc add <mudname>            - add a new IMC connection entry
         imc set <...>                - set the details of an IMC connection
         imc delete <mudname>         - remove an IMC connection
         imc rename <old> <new>       - rename an IMC connection
         imc reload                   - load a new IMC config file from disk

Add, delete, and rename should be self-explanatory. The name of an IMC
connection MUST match the name which the other end is using.

Reload destroys the version of the configuration in memory, and reloads it
from disk. This is useful if you have hand-edited the config file and want
to load your changes without rebooting. 'imc reload' also reloads the
rignores file.

The set command has several forms:

imc set <mudname> all <data...>     - set all values for a mud
                  host <hostname>   - set the hostname to connect to
                  port <portnum>    - set the remote IMC port to connect to
                  clientpw <pw>     - set the case-sensitive client password
                  serverpw <pw>     - set the case-sensitive server password
                  rcvstamp <value>  - set the receivestamp
                  noforward <value> - set the noforward bitmask
                  flags <value>     - set the connection flags

The 'all' form takes a series of values:

imc set <mudname> all <host> <port> <clientpw> <serverpw> <rcvstamp>
                      <noforward> <flags>

For information on the exact details of each field, see the IMC documentation.

51 'IMC IMMORTAL COMMANDS' RIMM RINFO RCODE~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
IMC Immortal commands:

- RIMM        : like rchat, but seen only by immortals.
- RCODE       : like rchat, but seen only by immortals. Intended for general
                coding discussions.
- RINFO       : like rchat, but seen only by immortals. The various hubs put
                status reports onto rinfo, which can be spammy at times; you
                may want to turn off rinfo for this reason.
- RSOCKETS    : displays debugging info on the current IMC connection state.
- RCONNECT    : force a connection to a directly connected mud.
- RDISCONNECT : forcibly disconnect a directly connected mud.
- RIGNORE     : ignore a player or an entire mud on IMC.
- MAILQUEUE   : show the current queue of pending inter-mud notes.
- IMC         : edit the IMC configuration for your mud (see 'IMC CONFIG')
- RCHANSET    : manage access to IMC channels/rtell/rbeep for players.

0 'IMC NOTES'~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Notes (boards, mail, etc) are very mud-dependent, but in general, if they
have been connected to IMC, then you can simply write notes to player@mudname
in addition to normal 'player'.

For example, you may be able to do:

note to abcde@somemud anotherplayer immortal@someothermud

and the note would go to:
  abcde on the mud called 'somemud'
  anotherplayer on your mud
  all immortals on the mud called 'someothermud'

The 'playernames' used are interpreted by the mud that receives them, not
your mud, so be careful when writing notes to group names such as 'immortal'.

If your note cannot be delivered within 12 hours for some reason (if the
mud is down, does not exist, or refused your mail) then you will get a note
from the system telling you so.

the player begs you not to!!!  The CR is not suppose to benefit the player,
just allow the player to get some of the eq back!

51 IMMORTAL~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
1. DO NOT KILL MORTALS! DO NOT KILL MORTALS! DO NOT KILL MORTALS!
PENALTY: EXECUTION (high god command =  reset char to level
permanantly)
 
2. DO NOT TRANSFER MORTALS TO AGGRESSIVE MOBS AND VICE VERSA!
PENALTY: Well it depends on wether or not they die. They die you
killed them see 1.
 
3. DO NOT LOG ON SOMEONE ELSE'S IMMORTAL OR LET THEM LOG ON YOURS!
PENALTY: Execution. Site ban. Delete. Depends on how we feel and
if it has happene before.
 
4. DO NOT LOG YOUR MORTAL AND IMMORTAL ON AT THE SAME TIME. 
PENALTY: Well this is fairly serious and if it happens you can
almost count on being deleted. Of course if you log them on and
then log them right off you might just get frozen for a while. 
but logs are on and if we catch you helping your mortal then 
you might as well kiss both chars goodbye and don't plan on coming
back.
 
5. DO NOT RESTORE MORTALS FOR ANY REASON WITHOUT PRIOR PERMISSION FROM
AN IMPLEMENTOR. This is not a joke people. I don't know how many times
people have asked me if they could restore someone. The answer will 
almost always be no unless it's another immortal. We give you that 
command because we feel like you know the rules well enough not to 
just go restore crazy. If caught most likely it will just be a freeze
but it really depends on if it has happened before. If so punishment
will be decided while you are frozen. Please don't test us on this 
we aren't kidding.
 
6. DO NOT RETRIEVE A MORTAL'S CORPSE UNLESS THEY'RE GOING BY THE CR RULES
This is a bad thing to do people, the CR rules are there for a reason
and newbie or not, no one gets a free CR unless they comply with the
rules for getting an immortal CR (help CR)
 
7. DO NOT MODIFY AREAS BEYOND BUG FIXES OR AIC ADJUSTMENTS
This is very serious, someone else took a lot of time working on that
area, not to have you come in and go "oh well this is all wrong"
and start messing around with it, the AiC is authorized to correct
bugs and grammarical errors, NOT to drastically change a zone..
including removing DTs or safe rooms

8. DO NOT KILL MOBS!! Do not kill mobs for ANY reason. Also DO NOT start 
walking through zones mapping them. That is called cheating and you will
then be at the mercy of the imps. ALso, keep in mind we have everything
logged, and if you do break the rules you WILL be caught.
 
((( Rules subject to change without notice but you'll be told before
we do anything nasty to you )))

proper places, or in their proper containers, and doors in their proper
states, (open, closed, locked).  The instazone command will clear out your
current resets (if any), and create new ones for you.
You may optionally specify "nodoors" so that door resets will not be
created.

NOTE:  This command will wipe out any existing resets!  Do not use this
command after you have added your own resets with 'reset add'.
The recommended procedure is to use instazone, then use the 'reset' command
to add any special resets, and NOT use instazone again.

See RESET and RESETCMDS.

1 INTELLIGENCE INT~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Intelligence (INT in your 'score') represents your character's mental
capacity.  Among other things, it affects:
 
 - heavily influences the amount of mana a character gains at level
 
 - affects the amount of mana regenerated or recovered at each tick
   if a character is resting or sleeping
 
 - the rate at which a character learns a new skill or spell
 
 - the percentage rate at which a character practices a new language
 
Intelligence is an important factor in learning between combatants.  If
a character fights a creature several times, the more intelligent of the
two opponents will gain an advantage over time...
 
Intelligence is the prime attribute of the mage.

1 LEVELCHANGE~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Well .. if your reading this, i guess your wandering WHY THE HELL
all this change .. heres whats up.. and it was my idea so i know whats up.
 
There are 3 classes of Immortals now ..
#1: The Ancients (levels 61 - 67) (High Gods)
#2: The Chosen Ones (levels 55 - 60)
#3: The Sevants (levels 51 - 54) <--- THESE ARE *** MORTAL ***
 
Let me explain .. Class #1, the Ancients will ALWAYS stay Invis.. they will be 
only heard, never seen
When in RL have you been sober and seen a god .. hehe ..
Class #2 are 'Go Betweens' between the Mortals and Us High Gods, they
can help quite a bit, and are Immortal, but can only do so much..
They will be able to see us if we choose to show ourselves to them.. and that
will be fully legal, Level 61+ Showing themselves to a Mortal is ILLEGAL.
The Chosen Ones have the OPTION of being Invisable, but may show as they
wish. They are our link to the Mortals.
 
Class #3, the Servants, are people we are watching and that we like. They are m
ortal but have been granted special commands by the gods, to help us 
deal with the problems of mortals, they may be able to deal with the problem
at hand, but if they cannot, they have a direct channel, that takes priority ov
er pray, that we see.
They Donot follow the rules of the gods, they are FULLY MORTAL.
They may act as they wish.
 
How Does a Mortal Contact a High God?
 
You May mud-mail one, or you may go to the Shrine, SOuth of Recall in Mithras
and type: pray <text> and we will see what you are typing.
Please Note, anyone Spamming the Pray channel will most likely
Die, if not worse.
 
Why? Well .. you will see some large changes for the better soon .. this has
to do with one of them.
 
Greywolf.

1 LIMITED~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: Thu Feb 10 00:39 MST, by: Taizu -=-=-=-=-

~
Certain pieces of equipment are limited in the amounts that can
exist in the world.  This is done to assure they are sought
after and that there isn't an overabundance spread around the
realms.  These pieces can be very hard to get as they won't
load after they reach the limit.  Therefore you may only have
limited equipment on 2 of your characters.  If you are found
with limited equipment on more than 2 characters you will
lose the equipment and possibly the character.
 
If you log onto the game with over 10 pieces of limited equipment
in your inventory you will go to the Hoarder's Void until you
get rid of the extra pieces.
 
You can tell if a piece of equipment is limited by identifying it.
Ignorance is no excuse.

Syntax: locker <open/close>

To access your locker, go to a locker room and type: locker open
If you donot have a locker, this will create one for you automatically.

Your locker will then appear in the room with you, i suggest using
put <item> <your name> eg. put stone greywolf
you can use: put <item> locker, however .. if there is more then 1 locker
open in the room, you take the chance of putting it in another players
locker.
 
To save to contents of your locker after you have finished, use:
locker close
this will save the contents, and put the locker away. these items
will stay in the locker untill you next open it, they save over
everything. The only one who can access your locker is you, so theft
is not a worry, only your character can access its locker.

 
changed 3/19.98 due to abuse of the locker system:
 
What you can store in your locker is now limited, it will NOT allow you
to store the following:
 
* Containers cannot be stored.
* LIMITED Eq cannot be stored.
 
Yhis was changed due to people with 17 sets of eq in there lockers
get a grip, escpecially limited eq.. if the old players have all of it, the new
ones cannot get it.

death to our chosen, for a fee of course. The society's past is
one surrounded by mystery and fear. No one knows the history of
we of Mist, but all that is known now is that we have been 
around for as long as anyone can remember. Until now, the very
knowledge of the guild was kept a secret.
 
   To join the ranks of mist you must be a minimum of level 25
of an advanced class. You must also be capable of killing without
feeling. We do not force our members to take contracts, but once
taken, the contract must be completed. It matters not how many
tries it takes, but the target must be dead. To break a contract
is to break your oath to the guild and the honor of Mist.
   A contract will be made between the assassin and the client. 
The price of will be decided between the two. Half of the fee
is paid before the killing and the second is afterwards. Remember
that it is the choice of the assassin, whether or not the contract
is accepted is up to him. If the fee is not payed following the
 
completion of the task, you will be hunted.
 
   Headhunters are the elite section of Mist. To enter the
enforcers of Mist, you must pass several tests and be judged
worthy of the HeadHunters. The spots are limited with the Mist
enforcers.

-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Suddenly out of nowhere, a hideous beast appears, bringing with it the
horrible smell of brimstone, death and decay!

The demon gives you the most evil and spine tingling sneer that makes you
fall to your knees, and release your bladder... 

The next second, the immense mass of slimey muscle and claws is all over you
...shredding you to a bloody mess!

Mercifully, everything goes black as it moves its widening maw towards your
head...

...Everything begins to fade to black.

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel
indeed much more free than you have ever felt before...

You float high into the heavens... a vortex of ever-changing curved beams
of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

A strange chorus of voices begins to sing indecipherable and long forgotten
words... the singing grows louder and louder... a million voices as one.

You feel yourself losing touch with reality... and all goes quiet.

-1 M_GODLVL2_~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
...You begin to feel light-headed.

Your hands begin to tingle softly...
The feeling quickly grows into a strange radiating pulse of energy! 

The tingle rises up your arms and into your head, filing your mind with
visions of worlds of wonder, far off places, great towers, vast mountains,
oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...
 
You sense a feeling of wonderous potential and power in your hands...
Enough power to build and create these visions for yourself!

You feel much more powerful, eager and inspired!
~

-1 M_GODLVL3_~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
...You feel slightly faint as your head begins to spin.

Your hands begin to tingle once more...
A vortex of energy starts to swirl throughout your hands, going faster
and faster... becoming almost painful! 

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magick rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...
 
You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

51 NO-HISTORY~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
"The strong are here to justify the weak"
 
That motto has lead the New Order to many victories.. and it stays
with us through our existance
 
The New Order started with Benvolio creating the castle and forming the
clan itself, he assigned Lucifer as leader.. The clan at this time
was all of 2 people, one a level 50 avatar and one a level 62 god.
 
All that changed when Callinon was inducted as a level 15 avatar.
He brought the clan into power, bringing into the clan more people
who in turn brought more in, eventually the clan composed of 75
people, almost 4 times the size of the second largest clan, WF
 
Through the great move the clan diminished, to the point where you
considered yourself lucky to see 2 at the same time....
 
And in this time, we now live, as we begin to expand our ranks again
until the New Order is as powerful as it was, and ever growing.
~

51 NO-INDUCTION~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
In order to become a member of the New Order, there is a proceedure
to follow, to insure we only get people who really want to be here :)
 
1) You must contact a member of the Induction Team (all members have
   -(IT)- in their title and on their insignia)
2) That member will interview you, if you pass the interview you will
   be given a quest to complete, and a set of restrictions to completing
   it (all quests are given within the level range of the inductee)
2b) If you fail the quest or don't meet all the requirements (i.e.
    you leveled too much) You will be given a second quest to fit your
    present self (leveling in second classes counts)
3) If you complete the quest you will be inducted and given an insignia
   You will also likely be given a tour of the castle so you know what's
   where
 
Hope to see you in the clan soon
Callinon Soulforge, Deity of the New Order

51 NO-RULES~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Most of our rules are spelled out in help clanrules.. but here's a few
that aren't....
 
1) Anyone behaving in an offensive way such as making an ass of yourself
   on a public channel or badmouthing another clan will likely be
   dismembered (kicked out of the clan)
2) Anyone causing a war (this has happened so don't laugh) will definately
   be removed from the clan and set with an outcast flag preventing
   you from joining another one
3) Anyone selling, auctioning, giving, or donating clan equipment will
   be outcast immediately, this is mentioned in help clanrules but
   I'm putting it here too, in order to emphisize the importance of it
   (I've worked long and hard on this equipment I don't want to see
    my work wasted)
4) Pay attention to the clan board (no real penelty for not except
   that you won't know what's going on)

NOTE SUBJECT sets the subject line of a new note.  NOTE TO sets the list of
recipients.  The recipient ALL means all players, and the recipient IMMORTAL
means all immortals.

NOTE WRITE puts you into edit mode, where you can easily enter your note
with use of some simple editor commands:
            /? - help    /s - save    /l - list    /c - clear

NOTE SHOW shows your note in progress; NOTE CLEAR starts over.

NOTE POST posts your note for reading.  Posting is not automatic.

NOTE REMOVE removes the entire note if you are the sender, or just removes you
from the to-list if you are a recipient.

NOTE TAKE takes the note as in NOTE REMOVE, as well as physically taking 
it in your inventory.

Notes now require a blank note to be held in your hands, and a quill to 
be in your inventory.

51 OSET~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Syntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>

If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.
 
If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.
 
OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives
you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of OSET ON, simply
type the word DONE. Example:
 
        oset staff on
        long A long gnarled staff of burnished oak lies here.
        type staff
        done

This file entails our PK System, please read this carefully.
 
Becoming a PKer: You MUST sign the Book of Blood.
       The book is located in Mithras (East of RECALL)
     Type SIGN BOOK in that room, to become PK, be warned .. 
     IT CANNOT EVER BE REMOVED!!!!
 
LOOTING:
     Looting is *ILLEGAL* Period! If you loot by accedent, you MUST
     Give any and all eq back when asked. The only Item you may take
     Off a corpse is the club insignia. Not the CHAMPS insig, only
     a regular club insig.
 
PLAYER KILLING RESTRICTIONS:
     * You May NOT kill in Town (Mithras)
     * You may NOT Interfere with a CR, no killing people trying to
       to get there corpses back!!
     * You May NOT Kill people whom are in a room with Saccing Mobiles
       Looting Mobiles, or aggressive Mobiles.
 
 LEVEL RESTRICTIONS:
     * For Single Class Player Killers:
          The Player Must be WITHIN 5 levels of yourself.
     * For Dual Class Player Killers:
          The Player Must be WITHIN 10 Levels, of ethier one of your classes
     * For Advanced Class Player Killers:
          The Player MUST be within 10 Levels of your ADVANCED Class
     * For Dual Advanced Player Killers:
          The Player MUST be within 10 Levels of your QUAD Class
 
The One exception to these rules, is players who donot have thier 
safety flag active. You may kill any player at any level who does not
have this flag on.
 
For Lower Players who choose to attack people higher then your PK Range
its your funeral.
 
 SAFETY FLAGS:
     Everyone has one. What it is, is a toggle, that if on enforces the
     PK Rules, you cannot be killed by someone who is out of your PK range
     if you have this flag on. If you are NON-PK, this flag prevents all
     player killers from attacking you. If you are PK OR NON-PK and you
     choose to turn this flag OFF, you are open to be attacked, by ANYONE
 
     The Safety Toggle may be turned on and off by typing: Safety.
     The Status shows up in your score Sheet. 
     When you enter the game, this flag will be SET TO ACTIVE, you must
     disable it manually each time you logon.

     I find this system, fair, and not to restrictive. Abuse of it
     will result in changes to make it ethier more restrictive, or
     for those who use it as a shield, less restriction.

     ** NOTE: Your Safety Flag WILL be disabled if you attack Someone! **
              you MUST reactivate it manually AFTER the fight, you CANNOT
              do it fighting!

Have Fun!

---==[ Age of the Ancients Policies ]==---
	      ----------------------------------------------

	These Policies are in place to make this game run well, and avoid
problems that we have experianced in the past.

Policies for Mortals are as follows:

1. Any Hyperion's word is final, if you wish to dispute the
   decision, you must take it up with that Hyperion. Should
   you choose to take your problem to another Hyperion. The
   penalty is a siteban. If you feel unjustified, please 
   post a note on the Mortal Concerns Board. And it will
   be reviewed, keep in mind, this board is not for vulgarity
   and insults, concerns only. Please be civil, or it will be
   ingnored .. if your lucky.

2. Clans are to be run by Mortals, there will be NO Immortals
   in clans, if an Immortal interferes in a clan, and a rule
   has not been broken, ie. they dont need to be there. Report
   it to a Hyperion Instantly.

3. There is to be no vulgar language on any global channel other
   then the flame channel, keep in mind racist remarks and insults
   targeted towards others will not be tolerated, use tells for this
   if you must.

4. The word of an Immortal is law, unless you are told by someone
   whom you KNOW outranks the first Immortal.

5. It is illegal to shove a player into a DT.
   It is illegal to use an aggressive mob to guard a players corpse.

6. You may NOT Sacrifice player corpses, this includes summoning
   mobs that loot, and or sac to do it for you. If you do this,
   you are the cause, and you get the punishment.

7. Looting a player corpse is illegal, penalty is that all your
   eq goes to the person/people you looted. and you get nothing,
   except maybe a demotion.

8. Lastly, please use comman sence. These rules are here for the
   betterment of the game. Anyone found following these rules by
   word, rather then spirit will be frowned upon.

0 PSIONICIST PSIONIC~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
A psionicist's powers come from their complex mind, unlike a mage
which derives almost all of its power from outside elements,
the psionicist derives all of its power from its personal resevoir
of power, even with all this he still manages to maintain a good
physical condition and does fairly well in non-magical combat as well
as the occasional wizard's duel
 
However because the psionicist can't maintain concentration on one
thing for very long, his powers don't have the same longevity as
one whos powers are not directly controlled by his mind

do the social would be wink, but make them your own as you dont 
want to lose the socials already in place that are available to all

base from which to build
 
CNOARG  this is what YOU see is you just type the social example
      if you just typed  wink
ONOARG  this is what everyone else in the room sees if you just

0 QUEST QUESTS QWEST~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Certain characters in the game will allow you to go on quests to recover an
item or kill another mob. To go on a quest, you must be in the same room with
a questmaster. When you successfully complete a quest, you will receive a
certain number of quest points. These points may be saved up and used to buy
incredible items from the questmaster.

The QUEST command is used for information about your current quest, to request
a quest from a questmaster, etc. Commands are as follows:

QWEST POINTS - Gives your current number of quest points. This command may
be used anywhere.

QWEST INFO - If you are on a quest, this will remind you who or what you
are after.

QWEST TIME - Gives the amount of time remaining on your current quest, or the
amount of time until you can request another quest. This command may be used
anywhere.

QWEST REQUEST - Petitions the questmaster to send you on a quest. If you
accept the quest, you will be given a realtime limit (in minutes) in which you
must complete the quest.

QWEST COMPLETE - Once you have completed your quest and recovered the item or
killed the mob or whatever, you must return to the questmaster who sent you on
the quest and use this command. If you have successfully completed your quest,
he will reward you with gold and quest points. Once you complete a quest you
cannot request another for 10 minutes.

QWEST LIST - Displays the list of fabulous items for sale by the questmaster.
These items are not buyable via gold, they must be purchased with quest points.

QWEST BUY <item> - Purchases an item from the questmaster and deducts the cost
of the item from your quest points.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game
you will be back in the same room, unless that room has a prog that moves
you upon re-entry.
 
QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just
one command.  Nevertheless, it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you
get into the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other
mud that doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.
 
There is no RENT here.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.

0 RANGER~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
A ranger is the outdoorsman and adventuresome free spirit of the times.  A
self-sufficent person, the ranger is adapatable and can survive in almost
any locale.  Skilled with weapons and able to utilize some of the finest
armor available, a ranger is more than skilled enough to defeat most of
his foes.  However, for especially hardy opponents, a ranger also can cast
many useful spells to both hinder his opponent and aid himself.  From minor
curative magics, to calling down lightning from a cloudy sky, the ranger is
the most adept class at surviving on its own.  A ranger typically travels
light, but he does have the mighty strength of a warrior to carry equipment
needed in his travels.  Like the druid (a class he closely resembles), his
need for help from outside sources is low.

When you first type in prize buy 3, you do NOT want to type anything
more than a keyword of the eq you wish to rename. 
Use the most unique keyword (ex. Black spectral would use Black, not
spectral, if you are wearing more than one spectral item) or, to 
avoid ANY possible confusion, remove all your eq and put it in a 
portal until only the item to be renamed is visible besides the 
portal.(ex. Prize buy 3 black)

2. Type prize buy 3 (item) keywords
When you enter this line, be careful to note step 1 above
Once you have set the keywords even once, the item is now recognized
by the new keywords.  Note: If you have more than one Keyword, it 
will recognize ANY of those new Keywords.
(ex. Prize buy 3 black fish scales)
 
3. Type prize buy 3 (new keyword) short description
Keep in mind the Help PCOLORS file in case you want special coloring. 
(ex. Prize buy 3 fish &bA &Osuit &gof &CFish &WScales&Y)
 
4. Type prize buy 3 (new keyword) long description
(ex. Prize buy 3 fish A suit of &Cfish &Wscales lies here)

59 RIGNORE~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Syntax:  rignore <player@mudname> [<type>] - ignore a single player
         rignore <*suffix> [<type>]        )
         rignore <prefix*> [<type>]        ) ignore a group of players

rignore ignores, at a mud-wide level, everything coming in over IMC for a
specified player or group of players. This means:

- rtells/rbeeps/rwhos will be ignored, and a rtell sent back to say that the
  mud is ignoring them.
- no messages from them on rchat, rcode, etc will appear on your mud.

This assumes you do not specify a type field. By default the type is set to
'ignore' which behaves as above. If 'notrust' is set instead, then the
specified player(s) will be treated as level 0 mortals, regardless of their
actual status - this means that, for example, wizi imms won't be seen by them
on rwho.

Prefix and suffix wildcards can be used, for example 'rignore *@xyz' will
ignore all players at the mud 'xyz', and 'rignore abc*' ignores anyone
with a name beginning with 'abc' on any mud.

Use with care.

59 SETBOOT~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Syntax: setboot time <hour> <minute>
 	setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from 
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

Firstly, BE CAREFUL! If you do this wrong, you will not be able to login your
character. Secondly, please put in BOTH the IP entry, and the HOSTNAME entry fo
r each of the hosts, as if name resolving is on, and you used only IP's then..
it will boot you, and same goes if you used all hostnames, and Name Resolving i
s off
 
Setting a Lock:
type: sitelock set <ip#, or hostname>
 
Hostname, or IP Format:
For static hostnames, or IP's, use the name of your ip, and the ip number
for Floating IP's (most dialin ISPS use these) use the following formats:
 
Your Host: blah.blah.aol.com
Your Entry would be: .aol.com
or
aol.com
 
with IPS:
Your host: 240.65.384.587
the last number floats.. so you use: 240.65.384.
 
Simple.
 
Deleteing Locks:
sitelock delete <host or IP>
 
Viewing locks:
sitelock list
 
Whats my IP?
sitelock myhost

1 STRENGTH STR~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Strength (STR in your 'score') represents your character's physical power.
 
The most common concern with strength deals with how much your character
can carry.  For each additional point of strength  you gain an additional
amount of maximum carryable weight.  Any character with 20 strength can
carry 500kgs; Warriors and Rangers can have a maximum of 25 strength, and
can therefore carry up to 999kgs when their strength is at its maximum.
 
Strength also affects (among other things):
 
 - damage roll and hitroll; for each additional point of strength, each
   of these will increase
 
 - chances of success for bash, stun, bashdoor, shove and drag, and the
   ability to dual-wield heavier weapons
 
Strength is the prime attribute of warriors and rangers.

0 THIEF THIEVES~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
The thief is a dark character which makes use of many skills often deemed
improper by the rest of society.  The skills of the thief reflect his way
of life, namely sneaking in the dark, picking locks, and attacking from
behind with deadly backstabs.  Thieves have always had a bad reputation
so don't be suprised if you are always under suspicion.  Thieves start off
fairly weak, but as they gain skills such as backstab and circle they soon
become dangerous foes.  A thief is always usefull when there is a lock
that needs opening or an item that needs to be stolen.

alot of will power from any Psionicist, and therefore is very short indeed.

0 TICK~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Many of the actions in the game are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell
duration, weather, and area resetting.
 
Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in the game average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.
 
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present.  Also
note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone
is in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' just prior to the reset.

2 TIP~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Grin
 
This is where i hope to impart my basic knowledge of the mud since i came
here all that time ago.
 
The tip that comes to mind foremost is that you can use 'mob' as a target
to kill creatures, it was made a long time ago and has been almost forgotten
by people, now i remind you all that you can use it :)
My favorite way to use 'mob' is to 'alias k kill mob'.  Now, the keyword
'mob' is useful, it attacks the first creature in the room, however, it
doesnt discriminate between an easy mob, such as a pixie, and a forest guard.
It also comes in handy if you want to look at or consider a mob but dont know
what word to use (con mob will almost certainly tell you the keyword of a
specific mob).
 
Thats my tip for today :)
 
If you have a tip you'd like to share with people, or have a question, send
me a mail about it and i'll see what i can do to pass your message on to the
rest of the Realms.

1 TRUE TRUESIGHT~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Syntax:  cast truesight
Syntax:  c true
 
Truesight confers the caster with a very brief immunity to blindness
(from attacks such as gouge or the blindness spell itself).  While
under the spell's effect, the caster continues to see.  Be warned
that when the spell wears off the caster will become blind should
the effects of the blinding attack still remain.
Truesight cannot be cast on anyone but the caster itself.
~

59 TRUST~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.

1 'TURBO' 'DOUBLEEXP' 'CHAOS'~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
.
AotA has some special features that affect the way your character plays.
These are:
 
Turbo-Fighting, where you can cast multiple spells/use multiple attacks
in combat.  When activated, there is almost no wait to cast another spell.
 
Doubleexp is as it sounds, it DOUBLES the amount of exp you get per kill.
Instead of getting 1million for the kill, you would get 2million exp for
the kill, and so on.
 
Chaos Mode, where EVERYONE is pkillable, and there are no safe rooms at all.
Nondeadly characters are free to kill pkillable characters, and pkill is
not punishable if you are in the city when it happens.
 
War-mode is similar to Chaos mode and Kombat mode, the difference is, you
have to type 'war me' when War-mode is activated, and then you can kill
any of the other War-mode combatants, with the whole mud as an 'arena'.  All
safe flags and town-safety modes are still active tho, so dont kill in the city
or else you will be branded a killer.
 
I hope that makes it all clear for you.

-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Syntax: use <insignia>
 
This command will allow you to use the insignia of your clan
to return to your clan hall
 
Of course this will only work if you HAVE an insignia and are wearing
it
 
--------Contact an immortal of your clan to get an insignia if you
--------don't have one

~

54 USEPROG~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Syntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]
 
The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke
 
When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see 
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.
~

52 USERS~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Syntax: users <host ip>
Syntax: users <playername>

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.

This spell increases your perserverence when you are on the verge of

~

0 'VALLEY ELF'~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Valley elves are as tall as most humans.  They are thin and have sharp and
pointed features.  They are reclusive and resent intrusion.  All other sorts
of elves, including the drow, shun valley elves.  The latter, in turn, dislike
association with any races save perhaps gnomekind, whom they tolerate.
~

0 VAMPIRE VAMPIRES~
-=-=-=-=- Updated: UNKNOWN, by: UNKNOWN -=-=-=-=-~
Vampires are powerful beings which require copious quantities of fresh blood.
Here is a brief summary of how they compare to the other classes:
 
 - Vampires use blood points (bp) instead of mana for casting spells.
 - Blood points can be lost by taking large amounts of damage during battle.
 - Spare blood points can save a vampire during battle by providing a small
   burst of extra hit points (hp).
 - Vampires get a penalty to armor class during the day, and a bonus during
   the night.
 - Vampires may mist walk to their victims under cover of darkness.
   (help 'mist walk')

in a room where travel spells are not permitted?.

should be clear enough.

recipient in 'note list' will be a colon, a capital V or a capital C
accordingly.
