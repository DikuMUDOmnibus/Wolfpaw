On the BattlePlain of Armageddon &W[ &R20&c, &R20 &W]&w~
Standing upon the plains here, time does not exhist.  There is 
no day or night.  Nothing really holding you to which you stand.
You are totally alone, left with your thoughts of utter chaos in
the bone chilling cold.  Your breathe leaving a small cloud of 
grey before you in the pure darkness.  In the distance you can
hear the striking of swords and agonizing screams.  The stench 
of death fills the air and you silently wonder if you will be
the next victim of Armageddon.

On the BattlePlain of Armageddon &W[  &R2&c,  &R8 &W]&w~
Standing upon the plains here, time does not exhist.  There is 
no day or night.  Nothing really holding you to which you stand.
You are totally alone, left with your thoughts of utter chaos in
the bone chilling cold.  Your breathe leaving a small cloud of 
grey before you in the pure darkness.  In the distance you can
hear the striking of swords and agonizing screams.  The stench 
of death fills the air and you silently wonder if you will be
the next victim of Armageddon.

On the BattlePlain of Armageddon &W[  &R3&c, &R19 &W]&w~
Standing upon the plains here, time does not exhist.  There is 
no day or night.  Nothing really holding you to which you stand.
You are totally alone, left with your thoughts of utter chaos in
the bone chilling cold.  Your breathe leaving a small cloud of 
grey before you in the pure darkness.  In the distance you can
hear the striking of swords and agonizing screams.  The stench 
of death fills the air and you silently wonder if you will be
the next victim of Armageddon.

On the BattlePlain of Armageddon &W[  &R5&c,  &R9 &W]&w~
Standing upon the plains here, time does not exhist.  There is 
no day or night.  Nothing really holding you to which you stand.
You are totally alone, left with your thoughts of utter chaos in
the bone chilling cold.  Your breathe leaving a small cloud of 
grey before you in the pure darkness.  In the distance you can
hear the striking of swords and agonizing screams.  The stench 
of death fills the air and you silently wonder if you will be
the next victim of Armageddon.

On the BattlePlain of Armageddon &W[  &R8&c, &R10 &W]&w~
Standing upon the plains here, time does not exhist.  There is
no day or night.  Nothing really holding you to which you stand.
You are totally alone, left with your thoughts of utter chaos in
the bone chilling cold.  Your breathe leaving a small cloud of
grey before you in the pure darkness.  In the distance you can
hear the striking of swords and agonizing screams.  The stench
of death fills the air and you silently wonder if you will be
the next victim of Armageddon.

On the BattlePlain of Armageddon &W[  &R9&c, &R20 &W]&w~
Standing upon the plains here, time does not exhist.  There is
no day or night.  Nothing really holding you to which you stand.
You are totally alone, left with your thoughts of utter chaos in
the bone chilling cold.  Your breathe leaving a small cloud of
grey before you in the pure darkness.  In the distance you can
hear the striking of swords and agonizing screams.  The stench
of death fills the air and you silently wonder if you will be
the next victim of Armageddon.

On the BattlePlain of Armageddon &W[ &R11&c, &R11 &W]&w~
Standing upon the plains here, time does not exhist.  There is
no day or night.  Nothing really holding you to which you stand.
You are totally alone, left with your thoughts of utter chaos in
the bone chilling cold.  Your breathe leaving a small cloud of
grey before you in the pure darkness.  In the distance you can
hear the striking of swords and agonizing screams.  The stench
of death fills the air and you silently wonder if you will be
the next victim of Armageddon.

Standing upon the plains here, time does not exhist.  There is
no day or night.  Nothing really holding you to which you stand.
You are totally alone, left with your thoughts of utter chaos in
the bone chilling cold.  Your breathe leaving a small cloud of
grey before you in the pure darkness.  In the distance you can
hear the striking of swords and agonizing screams.  The stench
of death fills the air and you silently wonder if you will be
the next victim of Armageddon.

On the BattlePlain of Armageddon &W[ &R14&c, &R12 &W]&w~
Standing upon the plains here, time does not exhist.  There is
no day or night.  Nothing really holding you to which you stand.
You are totally alone, left with your thoughts of utter chaos in
the bone chilling cold.  Your breathe leaving a small cloud of
grey before you in the pure darkness.  In the distance you can
hear the striking of swords and agonizing screams.  The stench
of death fills the air and you silently wonder if you will be
the next victim of Armageddon.

Standing upon the plains here, time does not exhist.  There is
no day or night.  Nothing really holding you to which you stand.
You are totally alone, left with your thoughts of utter chaos in
the bone chilling cold.  Your breathe leaving a small cloud of
grey before you in the pure darkness.  In the distance you can
hear the striking of swords and agonizing screams.  The stench
of death fills the air and you silently wonder if you will be
the next victim of Armageddon.

On the BattlePlain of Armageddon &W[ &R17&c, &R13 &W]&w~
Standing upon the plains here, time does not exhist.  There is
no day or night.  Nothing really holding you to which you stand.
You are totally alone, left with your thoughts of utter chaos in
the bone chilling cold.  Your breathe leaving a small cloud of
grey before you in the pure darkness.  In the distance you can
hear the striking of swords and agonizing screams.  The stench
of death fills the air and you silently wonder if you will be
the next victim of Armageddon.

On the BattlePlain of Armageddon &W[ &R19&c,  &R4 &W]&w~
Standing upon the plains here, time does not exhist.  There is
no day or night.  Nothing really holding you to which you stand.
You are totally alone, left with your thoughts of utter chaos in
the bone chilling cold.  Your breathe leaving a small cloud of
grey before you in the pure darkness.  In the distance you can
hear the striking of swords and agonizing screams.  The stench
of death fills the air and you silently wonder if you will be
the next victim of Armageddon.

On the BattlePlain of Armageddon &W[ &R20&c, &R14 &W]&w~
Standing upon the plains here, time does not exhist.  There is
no day or night.  Nothing really holding you to which you stand.
You are totally alone, left with your thoughts of utter chaos in
the bone chilling cold.  Your breathe leaving a small cloud of
grey before you in the pure darkness.  In the distance you can
hear the striking of swords and agonizing screams.  The stench
of death fills the air and you silently wonder if you will be
the next victim of Armageddon.
